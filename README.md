Arduino Library for WipperSnapper web application.

## Adding Hardware
[Hardware Specification for adding boards to WipperSnapper](https://github.com/adafruit/WipperSnapper_Boards)

Communication between this library and the MQTT broker uses protocol buffers for serialized data. The raw protocol buffers used by this project are located [here](https://github.com/adafruit/WipperSnapper_ProtoBuf). This library contains compiled `.pb.h` and `.pb.c` protocol buffer messages generated by [nanopb](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb).
