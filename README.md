# WipperSnapper_Arduino
Arduino Library for Adafruit Wippersnapper.

NOTE: This library is pre-alpha.

## Installation

* Download the [latest .ZIP for this library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Wippersnapper_Arduino/archive/master.zip)
* Within the Arduino IDE, select Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library
* Select the .ZIP you downloaded

## Usage

* Within the Arduino IDE, select File -> Examples -> Adafruit Wippersnapper -> Wippersnapper_demo
* In `config.h`, set `IO_USERNAME` and `IO_KEY` to your Adafruit IO Staging credentials.
* In `config.h`, set `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASS` to your WiFi credentials.
* If you are using an Adafruit AirLift Co-Processor board - uncomment the `//#define USE_AIRLIFT` line.
* On a web browser, navigate to the [Adafruit IO staging website](https://io.adafruit.us/)
* Compile and upload the sketch to your board.
* Your board should automatically run the Wippersnapper demo sketch and connect to Adafruit IO.

## Hardware Compatibility
The following boards are currently supported by this library:
* Adafruit PyPortal
* Adafruit Metro M4 AirLift Lite
* Adafruit Metro M4 Express
* Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266
* Adafruit Huzzah ESP32

## Adding Hardware
TODO!

[Hardware Specification for adding boards to WipperSnapper](https://github.com/adafruit/WipperSnapper_Boards)

Communication between this library and the MQTT broker uses protocol buffers for serialized data. The raw protocol buffers used by this project are located [here](https://github.com/adafruit/WipperSnapper_ProtoBuf). This library contains compiled `.pb.h` and `.pb.c` protocol buffer messages generated by [nanopb](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb).
